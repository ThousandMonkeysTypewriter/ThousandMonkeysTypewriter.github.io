## Program synthesis using neural nets ([Neural Programmer-Interpreter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06279)) in Domain-specific language

### What is neural program synthesis?

In recent years, [deep learnig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) has made [considerable progress](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1801/1801.00631.pdf) in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and game playing.  The success of neural nets lets us to change the view on the way the software itself is being created. We can use neural nets to gradualy increase automation in the process oft programm creation, and help engineers to get more results with less efforts.

### What is Thousnad Monkeys Typewriter?

Using the deep learning technique, called Neural Programmer-Interpreter, we create the system, that first [learns by examples] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02353.pdf)
and then is ready generate simple scripts in the [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language), that is created cpecially for that case.

### Why do you need Thousnad Monkeys Typewriter?

Being software engineer, sometimes you have to create simple scripts (service, testing, integrational, parsing etc.) that just slightly deviates one from another. Instead writing countles conditions for each case, it's usefull to let AI to learn all cases for you, and to create each script for each case;


### Where do we go with all this AI?

Hopefully, with the progress of AI, in near future it will take less dull manual work to create software for every day use.
